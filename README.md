# spatial-events

Example project for rotatable and triggerable lists.

## Rotatable component
The rotatable component rotates a list of div's and must be used as followed.

Include the component in HTML like this:
```html
<div transition="expand" v-for="element in elements" class="rotatable">
...
</div>

<rotatable
  rotatable-class="rotatable"
  set-elements-event="elements-found"
  :interval="5000"
  direction="secondToTop">
</rotatable>
```

#### Indicating the rotatable div's
The attribute `rotatable-class` is required and indicates which div's need to be rotated.
These div's must have the `class=[rotatable-class]` property.
The div's also must be filled dynamically from an array `elements` as in `v-for="element in elements"`.
Another important attribute that must be set, is `transition="expand"`. This property takes care of firing a transition event, which is used for beginning the rotation.

#### Set elements
The array `elements` can be passed in two ways:
- Call `setElements(elements)` on the `rotatable` component.
- Set the value of `set-elements-event` to the name of the `$broadcast` event.

#### Set interval
Set the interval that the list is rotated by the attribute `:interval` (adding `:` interprets the value as number).

#### Set direction
The list can rotate in two directions. It can scroll to the top, which means that the second element becomes the first. This can be set with `direction="secondToTop"`. The other direction is scrolling to the bottom, which means that the first element becomes the second and the last element the first. This can be set with `direction="lastToTop"`.

#### Set animation duration
The animation duration for rotating the list can be changed in the `style` part of `rotatable.vue`.


## Triggerable component
The triggerable component triggers a sequence of actions for the first element of a list. It must be used as followed.

Include the component in HTML like this:
```html
<triggerable
  :trigger-events="['rotation-end']"
  set-elements-event="elements-found">
</triggerable>
```
and triggerable elements in the `elements` array in JSON like this:
```json
"triggerActions": [
  {
    "name": "fitBounds",
    "value": [
      {
        "lat": 52.931,
        "lon": 4.651
      },
      {
        "lat": 53.540,
        "lon": 6.446
      }
    ],
    "actionAfter": {
      "name": "wait",
      "value": 1000
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "fitBounds",
    "value": [
      {
        "lat": 52.957,
        "lon": 4.643
      },
      {
        "lat": 53.188,
        "lon": 4.920
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
This trigger sets the map to a zoomed out view, then waits for 1 second and then zooms in to another center. The `fitBounds` action zooms to the wanted view depending on the available screen size. The waiting only happens if the map actually changed. New actions can be made by defining the values in json and adding a `case` clause in the `getAction` function in `triggerable.vue`. In this function a function `nextActionsFunc` is passed, which must be invoked when the action is finished (e.g. for `fitBounds` the next actions must be invoked once the map is updated correctly).  

#### Set elements
The array `elements` can be passed in two ways:
- Call `setElements(elements)` on the `triggerable` component.
- Set the value of `set-elements-event` to the name of the `$broadcast` event.

#### Set trigger event
The sequence of actions can be triggered in two ways:
- Call `trigger()` on the `triggerable` component.
- Set the value of `:trigger-events` to the names of the `$broadcast` events. This must be written as an array of Strings.
